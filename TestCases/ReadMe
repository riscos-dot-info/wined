Regression Tests / Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~   ~~~ ~~~~~

-> Fixed in version 3.01:
Typing long leafname into savebox file icon then dragging to save caused
name to be corrupted (12 chars copied, no terminator).

Choose close on a modified template. A "save or discard" box appears,
but doesn't respond to mouse clicks. This was due to event handlers
being released by the routine triggered by closing of the preceding
transient ("save or discard") window (via menusdeleted message).

-> Fixed by 3.06:
Previous versions of WinEd allowed illegal use of long (>11 characters,
excluding terminator) template names. LongIdent template has example of
illegal name and also includes an example of past corruption due to the
Anni bug.

-> Fixed by 3.07:
Delete first window in list and the others don't shuffle up drag one
window into another browser and overwrites entry in display
(drag/reorder reveals it again)


-> Fixed by 3.092:

Clicking iconise put wrong window name and icon on iconised icon (&
didn't close daughter viewers as per the manual)

Steve Revill: "The main menu allows you to navigate into the selection
submenu even when no icons are selected. This is a bug as none of the
submenu items are of any use in this state (in fact, it just shows up
that three of them are incorrectly not being shaded when there's no
selection)."

Do a right click "select all" then try and move through
selection>submenu> items. Investigated: browser_releasemenus is being
called somehow immediately after the menus are refreshed (following
adjust mouse click) this releases the handlers (sublink in particular)
so subsequent menu_warnings aren't caught. Can't work out what's causing
the browser_releasemenus call. Perhaps the wimp's menus_deleted message
getting delayed across wimp polls? Finally done with bodge use of
global flag set when user clicks "select all".


-> Fixed by 3.14:

Anni Bug. This caused font handles to corrupt the start of the previous
icon definition (e.g. manifests in strange minimum x extent). It occurs
in template files which have different fonts in different windows. It
appears when a font is processed which is in an icon which is not the
first icon containing a font, but is the first occurance of that font
(where "font" is a unique font name/size combination).
The Anni template contains icons which cause this bug. Annok and Annok2
are very similar to Anni but don't trigger the bug. Setting the
REGRESSION_ANNI macro at the top of browser.c will reinstate the bug.
