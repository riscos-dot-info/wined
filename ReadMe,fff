WinEd
=====

WinEd is a template editor.

It was originally written by Tony Houghton and the last release by him was
version 2.87. Up to and including the release of version 3.22a, it was
developed by Adam Richardson. Since then, some work to allow the code to be
built for modern systems has been done by Steve Fryatt. Some changes have
been made to this help file, but the majority of the text remains the work of
Tony Houghton. Any comments should be made to Steve:
