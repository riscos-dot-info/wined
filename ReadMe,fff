WinEd

WinEd is a template editor.

It was originally written by Tony Houghton and his last release was version
2.87. Up to and including the release of version 3.22a, the application was
developed by Adam Richardson. Since then, some work to allow the code to be
built for modern systems has been done by Steve Fryatt.
